# Reconfigurable-Intelligent-Surface-

This is an attempt to build a simulator environment for a Reconfigurable Intelligent surface made of varactor diodes using MatlLab. Users can analyse the radiation patterns for the different incidents and reflect angles. Users can also vary other system physical parameters such as frequency, number of elements and element geometry and physical properties to see how those changes reflect in the RF domain.
In the second view, users can see how the capacitance of the varactor diodes behaves across the surface to produce given incident and reflection angles.
This work has been carried out with the supervisory support of the University at Albany, USA.

to use this, download RIS_URA_SIMULATOR_08.mlappinstall and install in to the MatlabApp.
